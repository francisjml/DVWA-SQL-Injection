# DVWA-SQL-Injection
SQL Injection Report for the Web app DVWA that comes in the Lab Machine Metasploitable 2

Exercise looking to exploit a known vulnerability.

This is my first Web pentesting report, performed on the metaesploitable 2 Machine. This is only for academic purpose. None of the techniques found here should ever be used without the web owner consent. Feel free to use it as reference for your own reports. Please, remember that this is my first web report, so there are mistakes here, I am learning. And english is my second language. That being said, feel free to contact me if you find anything that could have be done better. I won't change this one, but will use the feedback to improve the next one.
